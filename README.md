# The PS5 Index 

## What is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)?

In economics, purchasing power parity is a concept in which there’s a theoretical exchange rate that allows you to buy the same amount of goods and services in every country1. The classic example? You should be able to buy a Big Mac in America, and then say, fly to France, and after converting your American currency to Euros, buy a Big Mac at the same worth of currency you paid in American. Naturally however, there are many factors that affect this ideal, such as import/export fees, local regulations, and availability, and products end up (perhaps unfairly) costing more or less in other regions.

## Why PS5?

Having played video games for almost my entire life, I was quite curious to see what the prices of PlayStation 5's were, across the world. It worked well with the assignment, as the PS5 model is the identical anywhere you go.

## The Creation of the Index

### 1. Getting the data
Using sources on the internet, I found the prices of a bunch of different items in different countries. I chose 10 countries including Canada, and imported the local prices into a csv file. Since I imported the data into my own csv, I didn’t have to clean it.
