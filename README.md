# The PS5 Index 

## What is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)?

In economics, purchasing power parity is a concept in which there’s a theoretical exchange rate that allows you to buy the same amount of goods and services in every country1. The classic example? You should be able to buy a Big Mac in America, and then say, fly to France, and after converting your American currency to Euros, buy a Big Mac at the same worth of currency you paid in American. Naturally however, there are many factors that affect this ideal, such as import/export fees, local regulations, and availability, and products end up (perhaps unfairly) costing more or less in other regions.
